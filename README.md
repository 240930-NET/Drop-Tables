The minimum viable product is:

-  The user can make their own posts consisting of text and maybe an image. 
-  There wil be a profile page displaying user posts with a profile description and profile picture.
-  Profile should also have a follow
-  Has a login and registration.

Stretch goals:
(potentially autho)
-  Ability to search users.
-  Homepage displays random posts when none to display. (Recomended feed)
-  Gameification (Challenges, badges, popularity)
-  Sub posts.
